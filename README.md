# python_api_challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to find the best vacations spot. One that is not too hot or humid. After reviewing data from 500 random cities throughout the world, then extracting the coordinates, max temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness, only the best vacation locations prevailed. With this knowledge, the nearest hotels were pinpointed for each city destination. 

With all data analyzed, it was concluded the closer to the equator one is the warmer you will be. However, this same relationship is not true for humidity, wind speed or cloudiness.

Have fun on your travles around the world!
